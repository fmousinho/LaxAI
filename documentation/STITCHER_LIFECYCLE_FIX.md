# Service Stitcher Deployment Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ❌ Copy-Paste Error from service_dataprep
**Problem:** `service_stitcher/src/main.py` had code copied from `service_dataprep` that tried to import and save graphs on shutdown.

**Error Log:**
```
ERROR services.service_stitcher.src.main Error during signal-triggered graph save: 
No module named 'services.service_dataprep'
```

**Root Cause:** The lifespan context manager was trying to:
- Import `save_all_active_graphs` from service_dataprep (wrong service!)
- Set up signal handlers for graph saving
- Save graphs on shutdown

**Fix Applied:**
- Removed all service_dataprep imports
- Simplified lifespan to only log startup/shutdown
- Added proper cleanup of video_managers dictionary on shutdown
- Removed unnecessary `signal` and `asyncio` imports

### 2. ✅ Improved Shutdown Cleanup
**Enhancement:** Now properly cleans up active video sessions on shutdown:
```python
from .v1.endpoints.video_endpoint import video_managers
if video_managers:
    logger.info(f"Cleaning up {len(video_managers)} active video sessions...")
    video_managers.clear()
```

## Files Modified

### `/services/service_stitcher/src/main.py`
- **Before:** 169 lines with incorrect dataprep imports
- **After:** 130 lines with clean stitcher-specific lifecycle
- **Changes:**
  - Removed signal handling for graph saves
  - Removed dataprep imports
  - Added video session cleanup
  - Updated log messages from "DataPrep Service" to "Stitcher Service"
  - Removed unused imports: `signal`, `asyncio`

## Testing

### Local Testing
```bash
cd services/service_stitcher
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m uvicorn src.main:app --reload --port 8080
```

### Deployment
```bash
# Deploy service_stitcher
gcloud builds submit . \
  --config=deploy/cloudbuild/cloudbuild-service-stitcher.yaml \
  --region=us-central1
```

### Verify Deployment
```bash
# Check logs for clean startup
gcloud logging read "resource.labels.service_name=laxai-service-stitcher" \
  --limit 50 \
  --format json

# Should see:
# "Starting LaxAI Stitcher Service..."
# NOT see any errors about service_dataprep
```

## Related Changes Needed

None - this is a standalone fix for service_stitcher.

## Impact

### Before Fix:
- ❌ Error logs on every shutdown
- ❌ Unnecessary signal handling overhead
- ❌ Confusing log messages ("DataPrep Service")
- ⚠️ No cleanup of video sessions

### After Fix:
- ✅ Clean startup and shutdown
- ✅ Proper video session cleanup
- ✅ Correct log messages
- ✅ Simplified lifecycle management
- ✅ No spurious errors

## Deployment Priority

**Priority:** Medium
- Not blocking functionality
- Cleans up error logs
- Improves resource cleanup
- Should be deployed next time service_stitcher is updated

## Additional Notes

This highlights the importance of:
1. Not copy-pasting code between services without reviewing
2. Service-specific lifecycle management
3. Proper cleanup on shutdown
4. Clear, service-specific logging
