# Data Preparation Pipeline - Optimization Analysis

This document analyzes the current data preparation pipeline implementation and provides optimization recommendations focusing on reducing unnecessary Google Storage operations and maximizing in-memory processing.

## Current Pipeline Structure

The `DataPrepPipeline` processes videos through the following steps:

### Step Flow
```
1. import_videos     → Move video from raw to organized folder
2. load_videos       → Download video for processing
3. extract_frames    → Extract frames and save to storage
4. calculate_grass_mask → Initialize background mask detector
5. detect_players    → Run detection and save results
6. extract_crops     → Extract crops and upload to storage
7. remove_crop_background → Download crops, process, upload modified
8. augment_crops     → Augment crops for training
9. create_training_and_validation_sets → Create train/val splits
```

## Current Storage Operations Analysis

### Identified Storage Operations

#### 1. Video Import Step (`_import_video`)
- **Move**: `move_blob(video_blob_name, new_video_blob)` - Video relocation
- **Download**: `download_blob(new_video_blob, temp_video_path)` - For metadata extraction
- **Upload**: `upload_from_string(metadata_blob, metadata_content)` - Save metadata
- **🔴 Issue**: Downloads video just for metadata extraction, then discards it

#### 2. Video Loading Step (`_load_video`)
- **Download**: `download_blob(imported_video, temp_video_path)` - For processing
- **🔴 Issue**: Downloads same video again for processing

#### 3. Frame Extraction Step (`_extract_frames_for_detections`)
- **Upload**: `upload_from_file(frame_blob_path, temp_frame_path)` - Save each frame
- **🔴 Issue**: Uploads frames individually, but they're already in memory

#### 4. Player Detection Step (`_detect_players`)
- **Upload**: `upload_from_string(detections_blob, detections_content)` - Save detections
- **✅ Good**: Necessary for persistence

#### 5. Crop Extraction Step (`_extract_crops`)
- **Upload**: `upload_from_file(storage_crop_path, local_crop_path)` - Upload each crop
- **🔴 Issue**: Uploads crops individually, but they're already in memory

#### 6. Background Removal Step (`_remove_crop_background`)
- **List**: `list_blobs(prefix=f"{original_crops_folder}/")` - List crops
- **Download**: `download_blob(blob_name, local_path)` - Download each crop
- **Upload**: `upload_from_file(storage_modified_path, temp_modified_path)` - Upload processed crops
- **🔴 Issue**: Downloads crops that were just uploaded in previous step

#### 7. Training/Validation Sets Step (`_create_training_and_validation_sets`)
- **List**: `list_blobs(prefix=f"{modified_crops_folder}/")` - List modified crops
- **Download**: `download_blob(blob_name, local_path)` - Download each crop
- **Upload**: `upload_from_file(storage_path, local_path)` - Upload to train/val folders
- **🔴 Issue**: Downloads crops that were just uploaded in previous step

    # ... process crops ...

# Optimized: Pass in memory
def _extract_crops(self, context):
    # ... extract crops ...
    return {"crops_data": crops_in_memory}  # Keep in memory
    
def _remove_crop_background(self, context):
    crops_data = context.get("crops_data")  # Use in-memory data
    # ... process crops ...
```

#### Optimization 2: Consolidated Video Processing
```python
# Current: Multiple downloads
def _import_video(self, context):
    # Move video
    # Download for metadata
    # Upload metadata
    
def _load_video(self, context):
    # Download video again

# Optimized: Single download
def _import_video(self, context):
    # Move video only
    
def _load_video(self, context):
    # Download once, extract metadata, keep in memory
```

#### Optimization 3: Batch Upload Operations
```python
# Current: Individual uploads
for crop in crops:
    self.tenant_storage.upload_from_file(path, crop)

# Optimized: Batch upload
self.tenant_storage.upload_batch(crops_dict)
```

### 🔧 Implementation Details

#### Data Flow Optimization
```python
# Before: Upload → Download → Process → Upload
_extract_crops() → uploads to storage
_remove_crop_background() → downloads from storage, processes, uploads
_create_training_and_validation_sets() → downloads from storage, processes, uploads

# After: Process → Pass in Memory → Process → Upload Final
_extract_crops() → keeps in memory + uploads for persistence
_remove_crop_background() → uses in-memory data, processes, uploads final + passes in memory
_create_training_and_validation_sets() → uses in-memory data, processes, uploads final
```

#### Memory Management
