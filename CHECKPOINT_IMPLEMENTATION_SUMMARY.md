# Pipeline Checkpoint and Resume System - Implementation Summary

## ✅ Implementation Complete

The checkpoint and resume functionality has been successfully implemented in the base Pipeline class as requested. This provides restart capabilities for interrupted pipelines across all pipeline implementations.

## 🎯 Key Achievements

### 1. **Base Pipeline Enhancement**
- ✅ Added `resume_from_checkpoint` parameter to `Pipeline.run()` method
- ✅ Implemented automatic checkpoint saving after each step
- ✅ Added checkpoint loading and validation
- ✅ Automatic checkpoint cleanup on successful completion
- ✅ Seamless integration with existing pipeline architecture

### 2. **Core Checkpoint Methods**
- ✅ `_save_checkpoint()` - Saves pipeline state to Google Storage
- ✅ `_load_checkpoint()` - Loads and validates checkpoint data
- ✅ `_validate_checkpoint()` - Ensures checkpoint compatibility
- ✅ `_restore_from_checkpoint()` - Restores pipeline state
- ✅ `_cleanup_checkpoint()` - Removes checkpoint on completion

### 3. **DataPrepPipeline Integration**
- ✅ Updated to use base class checkpoint functionality
- ✅ Removed old checkpoint logic (no longer needed)
- ✅ Maintains all existing optimizations (in-memory processing)
- ✅ Preserves context across restarts

### 4. **Google Storage Integration**
- ✅ Added `download_as_string()` method to GoogleStorageClient
- ✅ Checkpoints stored as JSON in pipeline run folder
- ✅ Automatic blob existence checking
- ✅ Proper error handling and fallback

## 🔧 Implementation Details

### **Checkpoint File Structure**
```json
{
  "pipeline_name": "train_pipeline",
  "run_guid": "uuid-string",
  "completed_steps": ["step1", "step2", "step3"],
  "context": {
    "video_path": "path/to/video.mp4",
    "crops_in_memory": {...},
    "modified_crops_in_memory": {...}
  },
  "steps_summary": {...},
  "checkpoint_version": "1.0"
}
```

### **Usage Pattern**
```python
# DataPrepPipeline with checkpoint resume
pipeline = DataPrepPipeline(config, tenant_id="tenant1")
results = pipeline.run(
    video_path="gs://bucket/video.mp4",
    resume_from_checkpoint=True  # ✅ Enables checkpoint functionality
)
```
