    "# LaxAI: Full Data Processing and Training Pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook orchestrates the end-to-end process of preparing data and training a model for the LaxAI project.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pipeline Steps:**\n",
    "1.  **Setup**: Clones the project repository (if necessary) and installs all required dependencies.\n",
    "2.  **Authentication**: Authenticates with Google Cloud to access GCS buckets.\n",
    "3.  **Configuration**: Sets up project paths and configuration variables (like `TENANT_ID`).\n",
    "4.  **Data Preparation**: Runs the `DataPrepPipeline` for all `.mp4` videos found in the tenant's `raw/` GCS directory. All processed data is stored in a single, unique `run_folder`.\n",
    "5.  **Model Training**: Runs the `TrainPipeline` using the data generated in the previous step."
