Memory Pattern Documentation for WandB Checkpoint Saves

This test documents the expected memory behavior for WandB checkpoint operations:

1. Initial memory increase during WandB initialization (50-100MB) - ACCEPTABLE
2. Small memory increase during first checkpoint save (initialization costs) - ACCEPTABLE  
3. Stable memory usage for subsequent checkpoint saves (<5MB growth) - EXPECTED
4. No continuous memory growth after second checkpoint - REQUIRED

Memory growth from epoch 1->2 is acceptable (initialization), but not from epoch 2 onwards.
