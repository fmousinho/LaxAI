"""
Test suite for WandB artifact version management and cleanup logic.

This test ensures that:
1. Multiple checkpoint versions are properly created
2. Cleanup correctly identifies and removes old versions
3. Version ordering works correctly with timestamps
4. Edge cases in version management are handled properly
